# debug-in-five-minutes

Project that was used on .debug conference to introduce Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) to the dev community.

If you want to try it yourself, you're going to need Android 4.2. Run the app on Android and iOS emulator. You'll see five bugs (actual bugs :D) on the screen.

To see the benefits of the KMM, open shared/src/commonMain/.../BugResolver.kt and try to solve the simple algorithmic challenges. Correctly solved challenge will remove one of the bugs in the app. This shows you how you can share the logic for Android and iOS app.
